# Chapter 2

The giant tube worm is a deep-sea creature that lives near hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor. These worms can grow up to eight feet long and have a bright red plume that they use to filter nutrients from the water. The giant tube worm has a symbiotic relationship with chemosynthetic bacteria that live inside it, providing it with the energy it needs to survive in the harsh conditions of the deep sea.

One of the most fearsome predators of the deep sea is the viperfish. This fish has long, needle-like teeth that it uses to impale its prey, which include smaller fish and crustaceans. The viperfish has large, light-sensitive eyes that help it to see in the darkness of the deep ocean, allowing it to hunt effectively even at depths where no sunlight penetrates.

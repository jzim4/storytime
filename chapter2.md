# Chapter 2

Another curious deep-sea denizen is the gulper eel. This elongated fish has a large mouth that it can expand to swallow prey much larger than itself. The gulper eel's stomach is able to stretch to accommodate its meals, allowing it to devour squid and other creatures that would be impossible for most other animals to eat.

The vampire squid is another fascinating creature of the deep sea. Despite its name, the vampire squid is not a true squid but belongs to its own unique order. It has red eyes and webbed arms that it can use to swim or drift in the water. The vampire squid has the ability to turn itself inside out, exposing spiny filaments that create the appearance of a cape. This defense mechanism confuses predators and allows the vampire squid to escape.
